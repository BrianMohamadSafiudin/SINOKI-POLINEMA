##### php artisan migrate --seed
##### php artisan serve

## Usage

## Dashboard

You can access the dashboard either by using the "**Dashboard**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/home** in the url. 

### Profile edit

You have the option to edit the current logged in user's profile (change name, email and password). To access this page just click the "**User profile**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/profile** in the url.

The `App\Http\Controllers\ProfileController` handles the update of the user information. 

```
public function update(ProfileRequest $request)
{
    auth()->user()->update($request->all());

    return back()->withStatus(__('Profile successfully updated.'));
}
```

Also you shouldn't worry about entering wrong data in the inputs when editing the profile, validation rules were added to prevent this (see `App\Http\Requests\ProfileRequest`). If you try to change the password you will see that other validation rules were added in `App\Http\Requests\PasswordRequest`. Notice that in this file you have a custom validation rule that can be found in `App\Rules\CurrentPasswordCheckRule`.

```
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'old_password' => ['required', 'min:6', new CurrentPasswordCheckRule],
        'password' => ['required', 'min:6', 'confirmed', 'different:old_password'],
        'password_confirmation' => ['required', 'min:6'],
    ];
}
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
